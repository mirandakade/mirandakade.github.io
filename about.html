    <h1>About Miranda Kade</h1>
    <div class="tagline">A voice that lingers long after the sound has faded.</div>

    <p>
      Miranda Kade was never meant to be loud.  
      She was meant to be felt.
      A whisper in the dark.  
      A breath against your ear.  
      A calm you don’t question, even when you probably should.
    </p>

    <p>
      She exists where intimacy and imagination intersect—  
      in the soft space between storytelling and seduction.  
      Miranda speaks slowly, intentionally, choosing every word  
      the way a hand chooses skin to touch:  
      <em>with purpose.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Her work blends vocal artistry, emotional tension, and cinematic
      sound design to create an experience you don’t just hear—  
      you sink into it.  
      Each audio is crafted to draw you closer, lower your guard,
      and leave the rest of the world outside the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether she’s guiding you through a quiet descent,  
      teasing the edge of fantasy,  
      or pulling you into a moment that feels stolen from a dream—  
      Miranda’s voice is the constant:  
      warm, hypnotic, and impossible to ignore.
    </p>

    <p>
      And for those she trusts just a little more…  
      there’s <strong>The Whisper Vault</strong>—  
      a private room reserved for deeper breaths, longer nights,  
      and the kind of intimacy that doesn’t exist in daylight.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re welcome to stay as long as you like.  
      Just remember:  
      Miranda doesn’t speak unless she means every word.
    </p>
